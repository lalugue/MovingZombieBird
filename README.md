A Flappy Bird clone based on the Zombie Bird guide of Kilobolt, with more!

In this version, the obstacles (pipes) also move vertically at random speeds

First built around 2014, ported/modified at 2019 to be uploaded in a repo

This was first built in Eclipse (there was no Android Studio yet at the time), then "ported" to Android Studio to simplify and modernize the program
